# MountaInvest
## Overview

For my senior capstone project I created MountaInvest which is a stock portfolio app. The idea behind the app is that I wanted to create an app that will be easy to use and save the user valuable time as they don't need to constantly monitor the financials as the app does it for them.

MountaInvest is an iOS app developed using XCode, that enables users to create a profile and save it to the Google Firebase Database. The app allows users to add stocks to their portfolio, including notes and target prices. Once the target prices are reached, users receive notifications. The app provides several views, including a home view, where users can log in or create an account. Additionally, the app features an intuitive interface, making it easy for users to manage their stock portfolios. No money transactions in the app.

## Features
* User log in interface
* Search any stocks (does this by fetching current stock data from Yahoo's Finance)
* Add stocks to user portfolio
* See graphs and additional values
* Add notes and target prices
* Receive notifications once target prices gets reached
* Settings with options to log out, delete user, contant via email form or reset password

##  Reflective summary

During this project, I hoped to create a fully functioning app that provides a great user experience and meets my daily needs for tracking financial markets. I'm happy to say that I have achieved this goal, as the app can now fetch real-time data from Yahoo and allows me to monitor and manage my portfolio on my phone. This demonstrates my system level understanding of computers as I was able to connect multiple parts of computer system to a functional app.

In addition to the broad goals, I hoped to get proficient in XCode which I did, I also got a very good overall picture of app development and feel confident in that area. I also learned a new programming language, Swift, and learned how to build a functional iOS app from scratch using XCode. I became more familiar with libraries and how to take advantage of them, for example, Firebase and Yahoo’s finance API. Overall I'm proud to say understand how to design, write, and test object-oriented programs.

On the nontechnical side, I've learned how to work in groups as well as individually. This project was big on the individual side and it gave me a deeper understanding of the essential parts of app development and how time-consuming they can be. I learned that good research is essential when planning, as it can help to avoid mistakes.

In general, I learned to be more critical of my skills and time and improved my problem solving skills, in addition I got to challenge my creative side. Lastly, I learned that I really enjoy building meaningful projects and realized that I’m very passionate about the areas that I study.
